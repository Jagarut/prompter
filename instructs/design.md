# Design

This document outlines the design for a Python utility that uses the Groq LLM provider service to instantly refactor and optimize user prompts.

## Core Components

1.  **`groq_client.py` (Groq API Interaction):**
    *   **Purpose:** Handles all communication with the Groq LLM API.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Loads API key from environment variables or `.env` file.
        *   Provides functions to interact with different Groq models (e.g., `chat.completions.create`).
        *   Allows setting customizable parameters like temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens, etc.
        *   Includes error handling for API requests.
        *   Abstracts away the specifics of the Groq API, making it easy to switch models or update API calls in the future.
    *   **Modularity:** Designed as a separate module, easily importable into other parts of the application.

2.  **`prompt_optimizer.py` (Prompt Optimization Logic):**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains the core logic for rephrasing and optimizing user prompts.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Takes a user prompt as input.
        *   Constructs a specific prompt for the Groq LLM, instructing it to rephrase and optimize the user's prompt.
        *   Uses the `groq_client.py` to send the prompt to the Groq LLM.
        *   Parses the response from the Groq LLM and returns the optimized prompt.
        *   Potentially includes different optimization strategies (e.g., making it more specific, adding context, etc.) that can be selected or configured.
    *   **Modularity:** Designed as a separate module, allowing for easy modification of the optimization logic without affecting other parts of the application.

3.  **`cli.py` (Command-Line Interface):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a command-line interface for the utility.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments (e.g., input prompt, model selection, output format).
        *   Imports and uses the `prompt_optimizer.py` module to optimize the prompt.
        *   Prints the optimized prompt to the console.
    *   **Modularity:**  Keeps the command-line interface separate from the core logic, making it easy to use the utility in other ways.

4.  **`streamlit_app.py` (Streamlit Web App):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a web interface for demonstration and testing.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.
        *   Includes a text input area for the user to enter their prompt.
        *   Allows the user to select the Groq model and set parameters.
        *   Includes an input field for the Groq API key (for hosted environments).
        *   Uses the `prompt_optimizer.py` module to optimize the prompt.
        *   Displays the optimized prompt in the web interface.
    *   **Modularity:**  Keeps the web app separate from the core logic, making it easy to maintain and update.

5.  **`.env` file (Configuration):**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores the Groq API key and other configuration settings.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Uses the `python-dotenv` library to load environment variables from the `.env` file.
        *   Allows for easy configuration without modifying the code directly.

## Extensibility

*   **New Models:** Adding support for new Groq models is easy by updating the `groq_client.py` module.
*   **Optimization Strategies:** New optimization strategies can be added to the `prompt_optimizer.py` module.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** The `groq_client.py` module can be extended to support more customizable parameters.
*   **Output Formats:** The `cli.py` can be extended to support different output formats (e.g., JSON, Markdown).

## Workflow

1.  **User Input:** The user provides a prompt either through the command line or the Streamlit web app.
2.  **Prompt Optimization:** The `prompt_optimizer.py` module takes the user's prompt and constructs a specific prompt for the Groq LLM, instructing it to rephrase and optimize the user's prompt.
3.  **Groq API Call:** The `groq_client.py` module sends the optimization prompt to the Groq LLM.
4.  **Response Processing:** The `prompt_optimizer.py` module parses the response from the Groq LLM and returns the optimized prompt.
5.  **Output:** The optimized prompt is displayed to the user either in the console or the Streamlit web app.
